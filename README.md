## Make Change Project
This project simulates a cash register.

The user is prompted for an item amount, and then an amount tendered.

If customer did not tender enough, register asks for more money until proper
amount is given.

Once proper amount is received, received amount is input to calculate how much
money will be returned.

Register informs how many $20, $10, $5, and $1 dollar bills need to be returned.

As well as how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies need to be returned.

Correct change is calculated and printed in largest to smallest denominations.
